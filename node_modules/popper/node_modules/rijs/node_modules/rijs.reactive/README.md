Reacts to changes in data resources. 

Traditionally in JS Frameworks, you will make a change, then run a different command to signal an update:

```js
ripple('data').push(value)
ripple('data').emit('change')
```

This module makes the second line redundant. More philosophically, as a reactive design pattern, listeners (e.g. views updating) should update themselves as an epiphenomenon of data changing rather than an application developer directly instructing them too. 

```js
ripple('data').push(value)  // triggers ripple('data').emit('change')
```

Uses `Object.observe` in browsers that support it or polling in browsers that don't.
